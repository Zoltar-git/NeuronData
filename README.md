<h1>NeuronData</h1>

<p>An auto-information collecting system in Manyland that stores usernames, bodys, dynamics, items etc.</p>

<h2>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The information that is collected with Neurobot is sent here which is then parsed and used in another script called Neuron.</p>
<p>A link will be added to Neuron upon it's completion.</p>
<p>You could also parse the Data yourself and use it in your own script.</p>

<h2>Changes to be made</h2>
  <p>`~~~~~~~~~`
    
  * Make an alogorithm that checks data that has been collected with the data just collected and only add the new data(oh boy).
  
  * Make a catagorizing system to put different entities into different groups.
