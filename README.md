<h1>NeuronData</h1>

<p>A auto-information collecting system in Manyland that stores usernames, bodys, dynamics, items etc.</p>

<h2>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The information that is collected with the Neurobot is sent here which is then parsed and used in another script called Neuron.</p>
<p>I will add a link to Neuron upon its completion.</p>
