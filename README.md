<h1>NeuronData</h1>

<p>An auto-information collecting system in Manyland that stores usernames, bodys, dynamics, items etc.</p>

<h2>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The information that is collected with Neurobot is sent here and then used in another script called Neuron.</p>
<p>A link will be added to Neuron upon it's completion.</p>
<p>You could also use the Data in your own script too.</p>

<h2>Future updates</h2>
 * Add a section for dynamics and also one for items
