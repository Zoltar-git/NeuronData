<h1>NeuronData</h1>

<p>An auto-information collecting system in Manyland that stores usernames, bodys, dynamics, items etc.</p>

<h2>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The information that is collected with Neurobot is sent here and then used in another script called Neuron.</p>
<p>A link will be added to Neuron upon it's completion.</p>

```js
(async () => {
	await $.getScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Zoltar-git/NeuronData@latest/Items/bodys.txt');
	});
```
<p>Use the code up above to use in your own script</p>

<h2>Future updates</h2>

  * Add a section for dynamics and also one for items
